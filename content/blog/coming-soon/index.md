### Welcome to Test Driven Algorithms!

This project started out as a way for me to practice and prepare myself for software engineering interviews, I would work on algorithm problems and write up my solutions for them walking through why I set things up the way I did and what the algorithm was doing in each part. After I landed a job, I stopped doing these write up's for a while.

But a friend of mine told me they found the write up's very useful and informative and encouraged me to start doing them again. So I thought I would create a site specifically for these and so here we are. But, I also want to work on my test driven development skills, so I am going to focus on developing algorithms in a test driven manner.

Over the next few weeks I will be working to build out the overall site and add the first few articles. Eventually I would like to move things to more of a video based walk through, but baby steps for now. Please follow along and connect with me on social if you find it helpful!
