title: Why TestDrivenAlgorithms?

description: What made me choose test driven algorithms to write about? What is test driven algorithms, actually?
---

When I first started writing up algorithmes, I mostly focused on writing up ones I was practicing with to prepare for interviews. Eventually I started working in ones that I got as actual interview questions until I finally landed a job and no longer had interviews to worry about!

*Well thats great Jordan, but how did we end up here?*

So, I eventually stopped writing up algorithms, getting caught up in the everyday flow of life and all that. But, I've had an itch for a while now to start creating my own thing, I just had not coalesced around a solid idea. I've put out a few things, but none seemed to stick. Until recently, when a friend of mine reached out to me to tell me that he really appreciated when I was doing my algorithm write ups. He had even referred a coworker of his to my backlog of articles on LinkedIn when they were studying for algorithm interviews.

After hearing that, I knew I had to get back to writing up algorithms again. If I had helped just one person, then this was worth it. But I have also been working on getting better at Test Driven Development in my day job. So, I thought this new project of writing up algorithms would be a great pairing with practicing test driven development concepts.

Each article will have the same basic structure, I'll introduce the algorithm problem we will be solving. I then will walk through what we need to think about for testing it, then we'll go through the actual algorithm itself. I am excited to explore these topics a little more in depth and hope you enjoy the journey!
